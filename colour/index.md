### Colour

They say '_Greys and blacks are always in trend_'\
So why does colour seem to offend?

They "Love the culture, but they don't love us" *\
'_Just leave the black and we won't make a fuss_'

Beige, tan, yellow and pink\
They say '_Why do your eyes have that squint?_'

Emerald, sapphire, ruby and gold\
Same trends after trends will continue to be sold

Tartan, check and tweed too\
Continue to be in fashion, reflecting\
the never ending\
archaic rule\
