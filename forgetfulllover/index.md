### Forget full lover

The fondest memory I have of you\
is not in a restaurant wearing fancy shoes\
is not on holiday seeing cultural ruins\
is not in a tent getting up to wrong doings

Nor is it in a hotel, pool or bar\
The fondest memory I have of you is eating curry in the car

Your head had been bleeding\
and my eyes had been weeping

Our love had definitely deepened\
