### For my best friend

I have never reflected about myself before\
Didn't think once about what others saw\
Didn't think once that I am adored\
What keeps me present are my flaws

Don't want to look back to relive memories\
Just look to the future to getting lairy

But y'see, the future hasn't happened the way I planned\
It feels like my whole life is a complete sham\
I keep making mistakes again and again\
I feel like I'm stuck in a U-bend

The shit keeps coming back, no matter what I do\
But y'know what, I'm not really sure I thought it through\
Maybe I need to go back to dislodge whats stuck\
Reflect on why the shits still there and actually give a fuck

I am learning about myself more and more\
which is actually opening up a lot of doors!\
