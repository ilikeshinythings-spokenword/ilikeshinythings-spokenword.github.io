### Have a try

Do you remember when you went to say bye\
Your carers would say\
'_Have you had a try?_'

I knew they meant toilet\
but now I know that\
'_Trying to do\
is as important\
as having a poo_'

Sometimes I'll fail and sometimes I'll learn\
I just need to remember to do it with fern (a.k.a fun)

Now anytime\
I'm in need of a cry,\
I remind myself\
'_Go on, have a try_'\
