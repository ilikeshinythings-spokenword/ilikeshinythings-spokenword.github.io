### I know you better than you know yourself

Didn't I tell you not to share personal details online\
I know you leave the house at 6:45

I know you get to work just before 7:10\
It was actually the clock in system that told me, my friend

You then have a coffee around 7:35\
I know because your fitbit told me that you were more alive

Your phone sends me more information too\
I know that its 18 steps for you to go to the loo\
I know that its 6 minutes if you need a poo

Now I've learnt your patterns and trends,\
Let me try to make amends\
I know that today, you spent longer on the toilet\
And your measurements are off, according to your fitbit\
My recommendation is calculating... You should go see a doctor.\
I predict that something might be severely wrong here

Do you trust that I am right?\
Or does all of this give you an unnerving fright?\
