### I know you better than you know yourself

Didn't I tell you not to share personal details online<br>
I know you leave the house at 6:45

I know you get to work just before 7:10<br>
It was actually the clock in system that told me, my friend

You then have a coffee around 7:35<br>
I know because fitbit said you were more alive

Your phone sends me more information too<br>
I know that its 18 steps for you to go to the loo<br>
I know that its 6 minutes if you need a poo

Now I've learnt your patterns and trends,<br>
Let me try to make amends<br>
I know that today, you spent longer on the toilet<br>
And your measurements are off, according to fitbit

My recommendation is calculating... You should go see a doctor.<br>
I predict that something might be severely wrong here

Do you trust that I am right?<br>
Or does all of this give you an unnerving fright?<br>
