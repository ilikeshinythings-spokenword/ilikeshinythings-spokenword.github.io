### ( I ) love me too

Enter my heart, I plea of you\
Knowing too well, you are a tool

Sleep beside me, eat my food\
As you sleep, you lie... Rude\
Inspire my thoughts, make me dream\
Pictures of us, until I scream

The future fog, finally lifts for me\
Pictures of us, I no longer see\
Projections of me, I now see clear\
Without your jibes, prods and overarching fear

Enter my heart, I plea of you\
Telling myself, I love you too <3\
