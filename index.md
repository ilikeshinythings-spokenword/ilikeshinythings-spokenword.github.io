### About the artist

Weeelllcccoommmeeeeee!

I am a spoken word artist based near the beautiful town of Hebden Bridge in the UK.

I write stories about my experiences as:
* Someone who works in data
* Someone who is seen as not white
* Someone who is seen as a woman

Hollie McNish has been a major influence on my work.

My writing should be easy to read and hopefully funny! (or ferny if you read [Have a try](https://ilikeshinythings.github.io/haveatry/))

I seem to really like to use poo and pooping as a way to describe my experiences so you might want to avoid these poems with a poo emoji next to them.

Here are all of the content warnings and the related emojis:

💩 Warning: poo references\
⁉️ Warning: sexual assault\
🖕🏿 Warning: swear words\
🧠 Warning: stalker/mental health abuse
