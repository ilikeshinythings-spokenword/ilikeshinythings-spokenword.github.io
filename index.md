Weeelllcccoommmeeeeee!

I am a spoken word artist based near the beautiful town of Hebden Bridge in the UK.

Hollie McNish has been a major influence on my work.

I write stories about my experiences as someone who works in data, someone who is not white and someone who is seen as a woman.

My writing should be easy to read and hopefully funny (or ferny)! I seem to really like to use poo and pooping as a way to to describe my experiences so you might want to avoid these poems with a poo emoji next to them.

Enjoy <3
