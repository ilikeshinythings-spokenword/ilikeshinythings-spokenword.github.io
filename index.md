### About the artist

Weeelllcccoommmeeeeee!

I am a spoken word artist based near the beautiful town of Halifax in the UK.

I write stories about my experiences as:
* Someone who works in data
* Someone who is seen as not white
* Someone who is seen as a woman
* Me :)

Hollie McNish has been a major influence on my work.

This is also a great book - Invisible Women: Exposing Data Bias in a World Designed for Men by Caroline Criado Perez.


My writing should be easy to read and hopefully funny! (or ferny if you read [Have a try](https://ilikeshinythings-spokenword.github.io/haveatry/))

I seem to really like to use poo and pooping as a way to describe my experiences so you might want to read these poems first, they have a poo emoji next to them.

Here are all of the content warnings and the related emojis:

💩 Warning: poo references\
⁉️ Warning: sexual assault\
🖕🏿 Warning: swear words\
🧠 Warning: stalker/mental health abuse
