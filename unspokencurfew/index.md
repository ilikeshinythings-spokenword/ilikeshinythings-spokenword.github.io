### Unspoken curfew

Who am I?

Everyday at 6am, I can walk to the local park\
I can walk to the supermarket in the dark

Every evening, I can walk the canal home\
I can be on the night bus, without calling someone on my phone

I choose to - not - walk with others\
I choose to - not - look over my shoulder\
I choose to - not - cross the road\
I choose to - not - use my headphones

I am - not - scared of someone bothering me\
I am allowed to walk the streets freely
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
Who am I?\
I am - not - a woman\
